# odin-recipes
A simple test website of recipes

This will be a test of everything I've learned so far from the HTML
section of the Foundations course over at the Odin Project
(https://www.theodinproject.com)

I've created a simple website with a central homepage that links to
three distinct recipe pages, each with varying levels of headings, an
image of the finished dish, a brief description, an unordered list of
ingredients and an ordered list of the steps required to create the
recipe. It was pretty fun and everything seems to work fine, but I feel
that the recipes I used were a bit...boring, really. It's also ugly as
sin. I will update this project with more interesting content and make
it look a bit better once I learn more things. See ya then!

# odin-recipes
A simple test websites of recipes

This will be a test of everything I've learned so far
from the HTML section of the Foundations course of the
Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com)

I will update this readme at the end of the exercise to
reflect on everything I've put into practice during it.
